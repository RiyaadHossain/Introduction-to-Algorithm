    Graph: A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. 

    Types of Graph:
        1. Directed/Undirected Graph
        2. Weighted/Unweighted Graph
        3. Cycle Graph

    Graph Representation:
        1. Adjacency Matrix
        2. Adjacency List
        3. Edge List
